# Drowsiness-Detection-System
Developed a real-time machine learning-based drowsiness detection system to enhance driver safety by detecting fatigue. Utilized Dlibâ€™s 69 landmark predictor and OpenCV for facial landmark detection and eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation, triggering alerts when signs of drowsiness were identified.
